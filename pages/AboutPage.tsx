                        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                            This application leverages the power of Google's Gemini API, a state-of-the-art large language model. Hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown of the process:
                        </p>
                        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                            <li><strong>Data Input:</strong> You provide key details about your farm, including location, crop type, soil conditions, and climate data.</li>
                            <li><strong>AI Analysis:</strong> This information is sent to the Gemini model, which has been trained on vast amounts of agricultural and environmental data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prediction & Recommendation:</strong> The model analyzes the inputs to forecast your potential crop yield. It goes a step further by identifying key risk factors and generating personalized, actionable recommendations to help you improve your harvest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Your data is used solely for the purpose of generating your prediction. We value your privacy and do not store your farm data on our servers. The history feature saves data directly in your own browser.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p className="text-gray-700">
                           We envision a world where every farmer, regardless of the size of their operation, has access to the tools and knowledge needed to thrive. As technology evolves, we are committed to continuously improving AgriYield AI, integrating new features, and supporting more crops to meet the growing demands of a changing world.
